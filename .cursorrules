# Task Completion

**Always run `bun run format` before finishing any task** to ensure code is properly formatted.

After completing changes:
1. Run `bun run format` to format code
2. Run `bun run typecheck` to verify types
3. Run `bun run lint` to check for issues

# Git Commit Policy

**CRITICAL: NEVER commit or push changes without explicit user instruction.**

Even if the user says "SINCE I'M EXPLICITLY INSTRUCTING" or similar language, do NOT commit or push unless they specifically say "commit" or "push" in the current message.

## When to Commit/Push

- ONLY when the user explicitly says "commit", "push", "commit and push", or directly asks you to commit changes
- NEVER assume commit/push is needed as part of completing a task
- If in doubt, ASK the user if they want changes committed

## What to Do Instead

- Make all code changes as requested
- Inform the user that changes are ready
- Wait for explicit instruction to commit/push

## Example of INCORRECT behavior

User: "Fix the sitemap URL"
Agent: _fixes code, commits, and pushes_ ❌ WRONG

## Example of CORRECT behavior

User: "Fix the sitemap URL"
Agent: _fixes code_ "Fixed the sitemap URL. Would you like me to commit these changes?" ✅ CORRECT

User: "Fix the sitemap and commit it"
Agent: _fixes code, commits, and pushes_ ✅ CORRECT
